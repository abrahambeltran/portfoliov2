                        Hello! My name is Abraham and I enjoy programming and
                        creating programs for the internet. I've had a lifetime
                        passion for technology and Iâ€™ve had the privilege of
                        going to Florida State University to further my
                        education on how to build, maintain, and secure tech. My
                        main focus these days is building accessible, innovative
                        products and digital experiences.
                    </p>
