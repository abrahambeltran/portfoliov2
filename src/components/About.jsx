                        Hello! My name is Abraham and I enjoy programming and
                        creating for the internet. My interest in web
                        development started in 2019 when Covid-19 just started
                        to make a buzz. Fast-forward to today, and Iâ€™ve had the
                        privilege of going to Florida State University one of
                        the top universities in the state of Florida. My main
                        focus these days is building accessible, inclusive
                        products and digital experiences at Upstatement for a
                        variety of clients.
